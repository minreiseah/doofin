# Project Log

Summary:

We have made progress in understanding trading system architecture and experimenting with different libraries. We are actively documenting our ideation and progress on our GitHub repository: [GitHub Repository Link](https://github.com/minreiseah/orbital/tree/main/docs). Please note that we are in the process of setting up our GitHub issues for better organization and tracking.

## Week One (40 hours total)

- Reading up literature on how trading systems are actually built (this was quite tough); spent about 10 hours each

- Experimenting with different libraries; another 10 hours each

## Week Two (26 hours total)

- Conducted a brainstorming session to finalize the high-level architecture of the trading system (5 hours irl)

- Researched and evaluated potential technologies and frameworks for implementing the trading system (5 hours irl)

- Started designing the *preliminary* data model for storing market data and trade information; (3 hours irl)

## Week Three (34 hours total)

- Collaborated on defining the interface contracts between different components of the trading system; still a work in progress (5 hours)
