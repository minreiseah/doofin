# Project Log

Summary:

We have made progress in understanding trading system architecture and experimenting with different libraries. We are actively documenting our ideation and progress on our GitHub repository: [GitHub Repository Link](https://github.com/minreiseah/orbital/tree/main/docs). Please note that we are in the process of setting up our GitHub issues for better organization and tracking.

## Week One (40 hours total)

- Reading up literature on how trading systems are actually built (this was quite tough); spent about 10 hours each

- Experimenting with different libraries; another 10 hours each

## Week Two (26 hours total)

- Conducted a brainstorming session to finalize the high-level architecture of the trading system (5 hours irl)

- Researched and evaluated potential technologies and frameworks for implementing the trading system (5 hours irl)

- Started designing the *preliminary* data model for storing market data and trade information; (3 hours irl)

## Week Three (34 hours total)

- Collaborated on defining the interface contracts between different components of the trading system; still a work in progress (5 hours)

- Started implementing the core functionalities of the trading system, such as data ingestion and strategy execution (12 hours)

## Week Four (40 hours total)

- Meetings to resolve feedback from Milestone 1, decide project direction, update work; spent about 5 hours each

- Learning how to use Rust, including features such as general syntax, memory allocation, ownership, and crate management; spent about 15 hours each

## Week Five (30 hours total)

- Trying to get the API to Interactive Brokers to work; about 15 hours each

## Week Six (30 hours total)

- Learning about pub/sub architectures, experimenting with RabbitMQ and Apache Kafka, and other things related to message brokering; about 15 hours each

## Week Seven (20 hours total)

- Meetings to resolve feedback from Milestone 2, bug fixes; spent about 10 hours each;

## Week Eight (20 hours total)

- Learning about how to write tests in python, wrote some test cases, refactored and rewrote some existing code; about 10 hours each

## Week Nine (30 hours total)

- Wrote up most unit tests and some integration tests, set up rust boilerplate for future development; about 15 hours each

## Week Ten (30 hours total)

- Finalised all unit and integration tests; about 15 hours each
